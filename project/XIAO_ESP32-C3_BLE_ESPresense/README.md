This document describes how to integrate the open-source Bluetooth presence detection system, **ESPresense**, with the **Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32-C3**. The presence detection node based on the XIAO ESP32-C3 can work with the [MQTT Room component](https://www.home-assistant.io/components/sensor.mqtt_room/) of Home Assistant to enable indoor positioning.

## Project Overview

**ESPresense** is an open-source Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) presence detection system designed to work with **Home Assistant** using **MQTT**.

In this migration:

### 1. Added XIAO ESP32-C3 Build Environment

The `.ini` configuration has been updated to add a dedicated build environment for **Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32-C3**. 

```ini
[env:seeed_xiao_esp32c3]
extends = esp32c3-cdc            ; XIAO ESP32-C3 uses native USB CDC
board = seeed_xiao_esp32c3
board_build.filesystem = spiffs
lib_deps =
  ${esp32c3.lib_deps}
  ${sensors.lib_deps}
build_flags =
  -D CORE_DEBUG_LEVEL=1
  -D FIRMWARE='"xiao-esp32c3"'   ; Firmware identifier
  -D SENSORS
  ${esp32c3-cdc.build_flags}
```

### 2. Improved Reporting Responsiveness

To make data reporting more responsive, several parameters in `defaults.h` were tuned as follows:

#### A. Increased Movement Sensitivity

The distance threshold that triggers an early report has been reduced from **0.5 m** to **0.1 m**. Even small movements will now activate the “early reporting” logic.

```cpp
#define DEFAULT_SKIP_DISTANCE 0.1  // changed from 0.5
```

#### B. Shortened Forced Reporting Interval

The maximum reporting interval has been reduced from **5 seconds** to **1–2 seconds**, ensuring more timely data updates even when movement is minimal.

```cpp
#define DEFAULT_SKIP_MS 1000       // changed from 5000, now is 1 second
```

#### C. Improved Wi-Fi and BLE Coexistence (2.4 GHz)

When using 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi (non-C5 chips), Bluetooth scanning is adjusted to avoid monopolizing the shared antenna. The BLE scan window is set slightly smaller than the scan interval, allowing Wi-Fi sufficient airtime for MQTT connections and data transmission.

```cpp
#define BLE_SCAN_INTERVAL 0x80  // 128
#define BLE_SCAN_WINDOW   0x60  // reduced from 0x80 (~75% duty cycle)
```

This change helps reduce internal contention and minimizes latency caused by radio resource preemption.

## 3. Wi-Fi & MQTT Configuration (Captive Portal)

- Power the XIAO ESP32-C3
  
- On your PC or phone, open **Wi-Fi settings**, connect to the ESPresense AP (e.g. `ESPresense-XXXX`)
  
  <img width="400" height= auto alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4b2065b6-bdf1-485e-980b-fea265b34646" />

- Open browser: `http://192.168.4.1`
  
  <img width="3730" height="1928" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b415ca5e-cc7c-41db-aaa6-7a61ec3eb071" />

## 4. BLE Device Broadcasting

Next, we need to make your personal device discoverable by ESPresense via BLE. In some cases, you may need to install an app to enable your device to broadcast over BLE.

### iOS Devices

Apple devices emit various BTLE continuity messages, often identified by the fingerprint `apple:100?:*-*`.
>In households with multiple iPhones, the nearby info may collide, leading to duplicate fingerprints.You can refer to https://espresense.com/devices/apple to resolve the issue.

### Android Devices (Manual Advertising)

Android devices are typically tight lipped and need an app to get them to emit BLE advertisements. Thus, the need for an app to allow us to find it.

- Install **nRF Connect** and open the app.
- Go to **ADVERTISER → "+" → ADD RECORD**, select **Manufacturer Data**
- Fill in:

   | Field      | Value                                            |
   | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
   | Company ID | `0x004C` (This is the fixed ID of Apple Inc., and all iBeacons must use this manufacturer ID.)|
   | Data       | `0215E2C56DB5DFFB48D2B060D0F5A71096E000010001C5` |

   **Data Format Explanation**

   | Section         | Description     |
   | --------------- | --------------- |
   | `0215`          | iBeacon prefix  |
   | `E2C56D...96E0` | UUID (16 bytes) |
   | `0001`          | Major           |
   | `0001`          | Minor           |
   | `C5`            | Measured Power  |

- Save and toggle advertising **ON**

-  Connect to:
   * Host: HA IP
   * Port: 1883
   * Username / Password

## 5. Room Presence via MQTT Room Sensor

### Edit `configuration.yaml`

- Go to **Settings → Add-ons → Terminal**, open terminal
-  Run:

    ```bash
    ls /config
    ```
    Confirm `configuration.yaml` exists.

- Edit the file:

    ```bash
    nano /config/configuration.yaml
    ```
    <img width="1665" height="723" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cd334a3f-2b13-45b4-af3f-89d4659125f0" />

- Append:

    ```yaml
    sensor:
      - platform: mqtt_room
        device_id: "iBeacon:e2c56db5-dffb-48d2-b060-d0f5a71096e0-1-1"
        name: "My iBeacon"
        state_topic: "espresense/devices/iBeacon:e2c56db5-dffb-48d2-b060-d0f5a71096e0-1-1"
        timeout: 60
        away_timeout: 120
    ```
    <img width="1888" height="877" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/124f720b-145f-47a9-a096-d8e80ecdfa74" />

>⚠ **YAML indentation is critical**
>* Use spaces only
>* Do not use TAB

- Save:

   * `Ctrl + O` → Enter
   * `Ctrl + X`

---

### Validate & Restart

- Go to **Settings → System → Developer Tools**
- Open **YAML** tab, click **Check Configuration**, if valid, click **Restart**

<img width="1754" height="749" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/29c7a513-5672-45b7-92de-208e72c87a06" />

---

## 6. Add entities to your dashboard

After restart:

- Go to **Developer Tools → States**
- Search for:

    ```
    sensor.my_ibeacon
    ```

- If the entity updates with room names, setup is complete
  
  <img width="1270" height="876" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/141503f0-2e59-46ac-a6b5-246279f8da2f" />

    >Sensor initialization may take some time. If the status shows not_home, please wait patiently for a while. If there is still no state update after an extended period, we recommend using MQTT Explorer to check whether ESPresense has gone offline or to verify that your personal device can be successfully scanned.

- Add the entity to your **Dashboard**
  
  <img width="1101" height="1292" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fa639868-edfa-41e1-adb0-8f86405c6b10" />
